# BiMap

**BiMap** is a web application that showcases the integration of two popular mapping libraries, **Leaflet** and **OpenLayers**, within an Angular framework. It provides a side-by-side comparison, allowing users to interact with both maps simultaneously.

## Features

- **Dual Map Display**: Interact with Leaflet and OpenLayers maps side by side.
- **Layer Switching**: Toggle between different map layers (e.g., Satellite, Terrain, Streets).
- **Synchronized Navigation**: Pan and zoom actions are mirrored on both maps.
- **Marker Placement**: Add markers to both maps for comparison.

## Technologies Used

- **Angular**: Framework for building the application's frontend.
- **Leaflet**: Open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps.
- **OpenLayers**: High-performance library for rendering maps in web browsers.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
